## Why is 2019_nCoV_killers?

![avatar](logo.jpg)

At the beginning of 2020, a war on [2019_nCoV](https://baike.baidu.com/item/2019%E6%96%B0%E5%9E%8B%E5%86%A0%E7%8A%B6%E7%97%85%E6%AF%92/24267858?fromtitle=2019nCoV&fromid=24267861&fr=aladdin) has begun in China.  In this year's Spring Festival, there are no bustling crowds, no visits between relatives and friends. The whole of China seemed to hit the pause button, and everything paused at that moment.

As students majoring in computer science in Hunan University now, we cannot be virus hunters or virus warriors in the first line of the battlefield. But now, we complete every lab of the Cloud Computing course well at home is the best support for frontline fighters. Cherish time, study hard and *day day up*(make progress day by day).


This time, we are all fighters in this war. We all are 2019_nCoV_killers.

## R.I.P üïØÔ∏è

The course has ended, and China's 2019_nCoV has slowly subsided. But other countries are still in dire straits. Thank you to the medical staff on the front line of the real battlefield. They are the real heroes of this battle. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this battle. They are also the heroes of this battle. May the deceased rest in peace, everyone can breathe in the fresh air and bravely embrace everyone around them.

People recorded the battle with [video](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/media/md28228968/), and hope that people will not forget it in the years to come.
